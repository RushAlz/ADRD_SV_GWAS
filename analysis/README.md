# SV GWAS with AD/ADRD traits

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Single variant associations and meta-analysis

Genome-wide association scans of structural variants were performed on a set of phenotypes covering multiple research domain categories related to aging and disease. Scans were performed using the tool SAIGEgds (Scalable and Accurate Implementation of GEneralized mixed model) (Zheng & Davis, 2020; Zhou et al., 2018). Single variant association tests were applied across 24 traits for SVs with MAC \> 10. All tests were controlled by age at death, sex, years of education, five genetic principal components, and the genetic correlation matrix (modeled as a random effect). Genomic inflation (Î») ranged from 0.59 to 1.09, indicating a reasonable control of population stratification and relatedness.

### SVs in LOAD GWAS loci

Let's consider a targeted approach to prioritize SVs near LOAD GWAS loci. We will consider SVs near LOAD GWAS loci.

### SVs with no LD with SNPs

After focusing on SVs in LD with AD GWAS hits, we now focus on SVs with no or low LD with SNPs, suggesting that these are potential new risk loci that are not tagged by SNPs and are independent genetic risk variants.
